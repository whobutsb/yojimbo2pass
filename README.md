Yojimbo2Pass
============

Move your your Yojimbo passwords into Pass. 

I have been using [Yojimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/) from BareBones Software for many years.  Over the last couple of months my workflow has become more unix and bash based.  So I decided to move my password collection in to [Pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/).  This simple bash script will read the exported files from Yojimbo and add them in to your pass folder. 

## Before you begin

Open up Yojimbo and export all of your passwords into a directory.  Change the FILES variable in the script to this directory.
